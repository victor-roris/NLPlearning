        "\n",
        "Closed-domain systems deal with questions under a specific domain (for example, medicine or automotive maintenance), and can exploit domain-specific knowledge by using a model that is fitted to a unique-domain database. The cdQA-suite was built to enable anyone who wants to build a closed-domain QA system easily.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we are going to use cdQA-Suite. The cdQA-suite is comprised of three blocks:\n",
        "1. cdQA: an easy-to-use python package to implement a QA pipeline\n",
        "2. cdQA-annotator: a tool built to facilitate the annotation of question-answering datasets for model evaluation and fine-tuning\n",
        "3. cdQA-ui: a user-interface that can be coupled to any website and can be connected to the back-end system.\n",

        "## cdQA\n",
        "\n",
        "The cdQA architecture is based on two main components: the Retriever and the Reader. You can see below a schema of the system mechanism.\n",

        "\n",
        "When a question is sent to the system, the Retriever selects a list of documents in the database that are the most likely to contain the answer. It is based on the same retriever of DrQA, which creates TF-IDF features based on uni-grams and bi-grams and compute the cosine similarity between the question sentence and each document of the database.\n",
        "\n",
        "After selecting the most probable documents, the system divides each document into paragraphs and send them with the question to the Reader, which is basically a pre-trained Deep Learning model. The model used was the Pytorch version of the well known NLP model BERT, which was made available by HuggingFace. Then, the Reader outputs the most probable answer it can find in each paragraph. After the Reader, there is a final layer in the system that compares the answers by using an internal score function and outputs the most likely one according to the scores."
