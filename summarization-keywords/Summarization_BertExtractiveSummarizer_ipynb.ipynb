For example, in case a patient requires to be provided with intravenous nutrition, it is especially critical to ensure the quality of the nutrient mixture supplied and the attention given [2]. The core of this system is the identification of moments or places where monitoring specific variables within procedures in order to control potential hazards. However, it is becoming more common its use in the pharmaceutical and healthcare environment [5], 6]. These records enable the application traceability mechanisms. The objective was to create a tool to carry out the implementation of controls (in systems such as HACCP) and to record the values obtained efficiently and in a cost-effective manner. Furthermore, it should allow to check and automatically analysis the recorded information in real time. Finally, in Section 5, a set of conclusions is laid. These monitoring moments or places are known as Control Points (CPs) [12]. In our system, CPs are intended to record the monitored variables and elements under control into traceable records, hereinafter, traces. Actually, this identification is usually done using labels on the entity itself or, in the case of logical entities, labeling a related area (e.g., the table where it is performed the control). These operations can be of two types, control or information. Specifically, a control operation defines variables that the user (automated agent or human) must monitor. * Security constraints: the system must ensure that this information will not be accessed without proper authorization. * Robustness: the platform must ensure its proper working and the traces collection even in adverse contexts (i.e., little or no connectivity). The client software will be able to access the server functions via secure connections (i.e., HTTPS protocol). Agents are provided with a graphic layer for user interaction. The server parses the query and gathers (and returns) the available operations. These operations are shown to the user in a list. Depending on the user's choice, the client agent requires the system description of the operation. These technologies allow the development of high-level functionality. Based on this, managers can perform better analysis and, thus, optimize effort and resources. In this case, the use of semantic technologies facilitates the implementation of  enriching  techniques for population of data using external information shared publicly on the Web (e.g., adding information about a drug component using data extracted from Wikipedia/DBPedia). Interested readers can check the performance of these techniques in previous works of authors [19]. SOPs often introduced flow diagrams in order to facilitate the understanding of certain parts of the procedures. Therefore, the HACCP system advocates only for implementing CP that are critical, also referred to as CCP (Critical Control Points). Using the proposed setup, it turns out feasible and convenient to implement the proposed technological system. In this case, the pharmacist will use the application to read the label on the bag of the PN. In addition, each requested field in the form has a description to guide the user. Using this tool, a paginated list of traces can be accessed. Screenshots of the Web client for: a) trace location on a map; b) graph for the average generation of traces per week. The system allows a simple and quick evaluation and analysis of trace generated during its application. In addition to this, the system also provides a flexible mean to access relevant information according to the specific needs of each user.

This URI will be generated by the system and will uniquely identify one single entity. Control operations can carry out a particular CP. These operations are represented as resources in the REST server interface. In this model, concepts (e.g., users, CP, etc.), Regretfully, the implementation of a CP is often a costly procedure. Given the scenario above presented, the CP1 will be described in the frame of the application. Additionally, the log of traces also provides detailed information on any procedure. Therefore, it is possible to take full advantage of process mining tools as ProM[1]. The CPs application allows to minimize deviations in the standard processes.
